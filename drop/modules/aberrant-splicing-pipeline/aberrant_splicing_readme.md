## Aberrant Splicing Module 

Go to the Counting tab and click on `DatasetsF.R`. Then, select the desired 
analysis group. 
It contains the number of introns and splice sites captured,
as well as two filtering plots.

Go to the FRASER tab and click on `Datasets.R`. Then, select the desired 
analysis group. 
It contains different plots like the steps towards finding the optimal encoding 
dimension, the number of aberrantly spliced genes per sample,
heatmaps of the sample covariation before and after correction, 
biological coefficient of variation; and results tables.

Splicing outliers are computed using [FRASER](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.866830v1) 
(Mertes, Scheller et al., bioRxiv, 2019).
