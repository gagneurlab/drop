Preparing the Input Data
========================

Config file
-----------

The config file is in `YAML <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html>`_ format. It is composed of general and module-specific parameters. In *YAML*, a variable can be of the following types: boolean, string, numeric, list and dictionary. They are declared by writing the variable name followed by a colon, a space, and the value, for example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # A boolean is binary and can be true of false
    boolean_var: true    # or false
    
    # A string is a text. Quotation marks are not needed.
    string_var: whatever text  

    # A numeric can be an integer or a real number. A dot separates a decimal.
    numeric_var: 0.05
    
    # A list is a collection of elements of the same type.
    list_var:
      - element_1   # elements are indented
      - element_2

    # A dictionary contains key-value pairs. It is a collection of multiple 
    #    elements where the key is a string and the value any type.
    dictionary_var:
      key_1: value_1
      key_2: value_2


Now we describe the different parameters needed in DROP.

Creating the sample annotation table
------------------------------------

For details on how to generate the sample annotation, please refer to the DROP manuscript. 
Here we provide some examples on how to deal with certain situations. For simplicity, we
do not include the other compulsory columns ``PAIRED_END``, ``COUNT_MODE``,
``COUNT_OVERLAPS`` and ``STRAND``.

Example of external count matrices
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In case counts from external matrices are to be integrated into the analysis,
the file must be specified in the GENE_COUNTS_FILE column. A new row must be
added for each sample from the count matrix that should be included in the 
analysis. An RNA_BAM_FILE must not be specified. The DROP_GROUP of the local
and external samples that are to be analyzed together must be the same.

Advanced options
----------------

A local copy of DROP can be edited and modified for uncovering potential issues or increasing outputs.
For example, the user might want to add new plots to the ``Summary`` scripts, or add
additional columns to the results tables.
Specifically, the number of threads allowed for a computational step can be modified by the user.

.. note::

    DROP needs to be installed from a local directory :ref:`otherversions` using ``pip install -e <path-to-drop-repo>``
    so that any changes in the code will be available in the next pipeline run.
    Any changes made to the R code need to be updated with ``drop update`` in the project directory.

The aberrant expression and splicing modules use a denoising autoencoder to
correct for sample covariation. This process reduces the fitting space to a 
dimension smaller than the number of samples N. The encoding dimension is optimized.
We recommend the search space to be at most N/3 for the aberrant expression, 
and N/6 for the aberrant splicing case. Nevertheless, the user can specify the 
denominator with the parameter ``maxTestedDimensionProportion``.

In order to influence which fields of the BAM files are imported, the user can 
provide a ``scanBamParam`` object. This will affect how the files are counted in 
the aberrant expression and splicing modules. Refer to the function's 
`documentation <https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Rsamtools/versions/1.24.0/topics/ScanBamParam>`_ for details.
