Preparing the Input Data
========================

The input files of DROP are: 

- BAM files from RNA-seq  (and their respective index files)
- VCF files from either WES or WGS (and their respective index files). Only used for the MAE module
- a configuration file containing the different parameters
- a sample annotation file
- a gene annotation file (gtf)
- a reference genome file (fasta, and its respective index)

For more details see the Materials section of the `DROP manuscript <https://rdcu.be/cdMmF>`_.


Config file
-----------

The config file is in `YAML <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html>`_ format. It is composed of general and module-specific parameters. In *YAML*, a variable can be of the following types: boolean, string, numeric, list and dictionary. They are declared by writing the variable name followed by a colon, a space, and the value, for example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # A boolean is binary and can be true of false
    boolean_var: true    # or false

    # A string is a text. Quotation marks are not needed.
    string_var: whatever text

    # A numeric can be an integer or a real number. A dot separates a decimal.
    numeric_var: 0.05

    # A list is a collection of elements of the same type.
    list_var:
      - element_1   # elements are indented
      - element_2

    # A dictionary contains key-value pairs. It is a collection of multiple
    #    elements where the key is a string and the value any type.
    dictionary_var:
      key_1: value_1
      key_2: value_2


Now we describe the different parameters needed in DROP.
When providing a path to a file or directory, please provide the *full system path*.

RNA Variant Calling dictionary
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
RNA Variant Calling may be useful for researchers who do not have access to variant calls from genomic data. While variant calling from WES and WGS technologies may be more traditional (and reliable), we have found that variant calling from RNA-Seq data can provide additional evidence for the underlying causes of aberrant expression or splicing.
The RNA variant calling process uses information from multiple samples (as designated by the ``groups`` variable) to improve the variant calling process. However, the larger the group size, the more costly the computation is in terms of time and resources. When building the sample annotation table, take this into account. For the most accurate variant calls include many samples in each ``DROP_GROUP`` group, but in order to speed up computation, separate samples into many groups.

Modularization of DROP
-----------------------------------
DROP allows to control which modules to run via the  ``run`` variable in the config file. By default, each module is set to ``run: true``.  Setting this value to  ``false``  stops a particular module from being run. This will be noted as a warning at the beginning of the ``snakemake`` run, and the corresponding module will be renamed in the ``Scripts/`` directory.

For example, if the AberrantExpression module is set to false, the  ``Scripts/AberrantExpression/`` directory will be renamed to ``Scripts/_AberrantExpression/`` which tells DROP not to execute this module.


Creating the sample annotation table
------------------------------------
For a detailed explanation of the columns of the sample annotation, please refer to
Box 3 of the `DROP manuscript <https://rdcu.be/cdMmF>`_. Although some information has been updated since puplication, please use this documentation as the preferred syntax/formatting.

Each row of the sample annotation table corresponds to a unique pair of RNA and DNA
samples derived from the same individual. An RNA assay can belong to one or more DNA
assays, and vice-versa. If so, they must be specified in different rows. The required
columns are ``RNA_ID``, ``RNA_BAM_FILE`` and ``DROP_GROUP``, plus other module-specific
ones (see DROP manuscript).

The following columns describe the RNA-seq experimental setup:
``PAIRED_END``, ``STRAND``, ``COUNT_MODE`` and ``COUNT_OVERLAPS``. They affect the
counting procedures of the aberrant expression and splicing modules. For a detailed
explanation, refer to the documentation of `HTSeq <https://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

To run the MAE module, the columns ``DNA_ID`` and ``DNA_VCF_FILE`` are needed. MAE can not be run
in samples using external counts as we need to use the ``RNA_BAM_FILE`` to count reads supporting
each allele of the heterozygous variants found in the ``DNA_VCF_FILE``.

In case RNA-seq BAM files belong to different genome assemblies (eg, ncbi, ucsc), multiple
reference genome fasta files can be specified. Add a column called `GENOME` that
contains, for each sample, the key from the `genome` parameter in the config file that
matches its genome assembly (eg, ncbi or ucsc).

The sample annotation file must be saved in the tab-separated values (tsv) format. The 
column order does not matter. Also, it does not matter where it is stored, as the path is 
specified in the config file. Here we provide some examples on how to deal with certain
situations. For simplicity, we do not include all possible columns in the examples.


Using External Counts
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
DROP can utilize external counts for the ``aberrantExpression`` and ``aberrantSplicing`` modules
which can enhance the statistical power of these modules by providing more samples from which we 
can build a distribution of counts and detect outliers. However this process introduces some
particular issues that need to be addressed to make sure it is a valuable addition to the experiment.

In case external counts are included, add a new row for each sample from those 
files (or a subset if not all samples are needed). Add the columns: ``GENE_COUNTS_FILE``
(for aberrant expression), ``GENE_ANNOTATON``, and ``SPLICE_COUNTS_DIR`` (for aberrant splicing).
These columns should remain empty for samples processed locally (from ``RNA_BAM``).

Aberrant Expression
####################
Using external counts for aberrant expression forces you to use the exact same gene annotation for each
external sample as well as using the same gene annotation file specified in the config file
``Global parameters`` section. This is to avoid potential mismatching on counting, 2 different gene
annotations could drastically affect which reads are counted in which region drastically skewing the results.

The user must also use special consideration when building the sample annotation table. Samples
using external counts need only ``RNA_ID`` which must exactly match the column header in the external count file
``DROP_GROUP``, ``GENE_COUNTS_FILE``, and ``GENE_ANNOTATION`` which must contain the exact key specified in the config.
The other columns should remain empty. 

Using ``exportCounts`` generates the sharable ``GENE_COUNTS_FILE`` file in the appropriate
``ROOT_DIR/Output/processed_results/exported_counts/`` sub-directory.

Aberrant Splicing
##################
Using external counts for aberrant splicing reduces the number of introns processed to only those
that are exactly the same between the local and external junctions. Because rare junctions may be 
personally identifiable the ``exportCounts`` command only exports regions canonically mentioned in the gtf file.
As a result, when merging the external counts with the local counts we only match introns that are **exact** between
the 2 sets, this is to ensure that if a region is missing we don't introduce 0 counts into the distribution calculations.

The user must also use special consideration when building the sample annotation table. Samples
using external counts need only ``RNA_ID`` which must exactly match the column header in the external count file
``DROP_GROUP``, and ``SPLICE_COUNTS_DIR``. ``SPLICE_COUNTS_DIR`` is the directory containing the set of 5 needed count files.
The other columns should remain empty. 

Using ``exportCounts`` generates the necessary files in the appropriate
``ROOT_DIR/Output/processed_results/exported_counts/`` sub-directory

``SPLICE_COUNTS_DIR`` should contain the following:  

* k_j_counts.tsv.gz  
* k_theta_counts.tsv.gz  
* n_psi3_counts.tsv.gz  
* n_psi5_counts.tsv.gz  
* n_theta_counts.tsv.gz  

Publicly available DROP external counts
#######################################
You can find different sets of publicly available external counts to add to your
analysis on our `github page <https://github.com/gagneurlab/drop/#datasets>`_

External count examples
+++++++++++++++++++++++

In case counts from external matrices are to be integrated into the analysis,
the sample annotation must be built in a particular way
A new row must be added for each sample from the count matrix that should be included in the 
analysis. The ``RNA_ID`` must match the column header of the external files,
the ``RNA_BAM_FILE`` must not be specified. The ``DROP_GROUP`` of the local
and external samples that are to be analyzed together must be the same.
For aberrant expression, the GENE_ANNOTATION of the external counts and the key of the `geneAnnotation`
parameter from the config file must match.

This example will use the ``DROP_GROUP`` BLOOD_AE for the aberrant expression module (containing S10R, EXT-1R, EXT-2R) and
the ``DROP_GROUP`` BLOOD_AS for the aberrant expression module (containing S10R, EXT-2R, EXT-3R)

Files to download
-----------------

The following files can be downloaded from our `public repository <https://www.cmm.in.tum.de/public/paper/drop_analysis/resource/>`_.

1. VCF file containing different positions to be used to match DNA with RNA files.
The file name is ``qc_vcf_1000G_{genome_build}.vcf.gz``. One file is available for each
genome build (hg19/hs37d5 and hg38/GRCh38). Download it together with the corresponding ``.tbi`` file.
Indicate the full path to the vcf file in the ``qcVcf`` key in the mono-allelic expression dictionary.
This file is only needed for the MAE module. Otherwise, write ``null`` in the ``qcVcf`` key.

2. Text file containing the relations between genes and phenotypes encoded as HPO terms.
The file name is ``hpo_genes.tsv.gz``.
Download it and indicate the full path to it in the ``hpoFile`` key.
The file is only needed in case HPO terms are specified in the sample annotation.
Otherwise, write ``null`` in the ``hpoFile`` key.

3. For the ``rnaVariantCalling`` module known high quality variants are needed to calibrate variant and sequencing scores to be used in the ``rnaVariantCalling`` module in the ``highQualityVCF`` config parameter.
These and the associated ``.tbi`` indexes can be downloaded for hg19 at our `public repository <https://www.cmm.in.tum.de/public/paper/drop_analysis/resource/>`_
and for hg38 through the Broad Institute's `resource bundle. <https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035890811-Resource-bundle>`_

hg19

* ``Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.hg19.sites.chrPrefix.vcf.gz``
* ``1000G_phase1.snps.high_confidence.hg19.sites.chrPrefix.vcf.gz``

hg38

* ``Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.hg38.vcf.gz``
* ``Homo_sapiens_assembly38.known_indels.vcf.gz``

We also recommend using the variants from dbSNP which is quite large. You can download them and their associated ``.tbi`` indexes from `NCBI <https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/>`_

* follow links for the current version (``human_9606/VCF/00-All.vcf.gz``) or older assemblies (eg. ``human_9606_b151_GRCh37p13/VCF/00-All.vcf.gz``)

The repeat masker file is used to filter hard-to-call regions. In general, this removes false-positive calls, however, some targeted and known splicing defects lie within these repeat regions. Understand that this filter is labeled ``Mask`` in the result VCF files. You can download the repeat mask and associated ``.idx`` on our `public repository. <https://www.cmm.in.tum.de/public/paper/drop_analysis/resource/>`_ for the ``repeat_mask`` config parameter.

Advanced options
----------------

A local copy of DROP can be edited and modified for uncovering potential issues or increasing outputs.
For example, the user might want to add new plots to the ``Summary`` scripts, or add
additional columns to the results tables.
Also, the number of threads allowed for a computational step can be modified.

.. note::

    DROP needs to be installed from a local directory using ``pip install -e <path/to/drop-repo>``
    so that any changes in the code will be available in the next pipeline run
    Any changes made to the R code need to be updated with ``drop update`` in the project directory.

The aberrant expression and splicing modules use a denoising autoencoder to
correct for sample covariation. This process reduces the fitting space to a
dimension smaller than the number of samples N. The encoding dimension is optimized.
We recommend the search space to be at most N/3 for the aberrant expression,
and N/6 for the aberrant splicing case. Nevertheless, the user can specify the
denominator with the parameter ``maxTestedDimensionProportion``.

DROP allows that BAM files from RNA-seq from samples belonging to the same `DROP_GROUP`
were aligned to different genome assemblies from the same build (eg, some to ucsc
and others to ncbi, but all to either hg19 or hg38). If so, for the aberrant
expression and splicing modules, no special configuration is needed.
For the MAE and rnaVariantCalling module, the different fasta files must be specified as a dictionary in
the `genome` parameter of the config file, and, for each sample, the corresponding
key of the `genome` dictionary must be specified in the `GENOME` column of the
sample annotation.
In additon, DROP allows that BAM files from RNA-seq were aligned to one genome
assembly (eg ucsc) and the corresponding VCF files from DNA sequencing to another
genome assembly (eg ncbi). If so, the assembly of the reference genome fasta file
must correspond to the one of the BAM file from RNA-seq.
