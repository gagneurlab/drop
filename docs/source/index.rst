DROP - Detection of RNA Outliers Pipeline
==========================================

DROP is intended to help researchers use RNA-Seq data in order to detect genes with aberrant expression,
aberrant splicing and mono-allelic expression. It consists of three independent modules for each of those strategies.
After installing DROP, the user needs to fill in the config file and sample annotation table (:doc:`prepare`).
Then, DROP can be executed in multiple ways (:doc:`pipeline`).

Quickstart
-----------

DROP is available on `bioconda <https://anaconda.org/bioconda/drop>`_.
We recommend using a dedicated conda environment. (installation time: ~ 10min)

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda drop

Test installation with demo project

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir ~/drop_demo
    cd ~/drop_demo
    drop demo

The pipeline can be run using `snakemake <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/>`_ commands

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake -n # dryrun
    snakemake --cores 1

Expected runtime: 25 min

For more information on different installation options, refer to :doc:`installation`.
